Description: This package provides a pipeline to analyze
        single-nucleotide resolution methylation data (Illumina 450k
        methylation array, targeted BS-Seq, etc.). It provides QC
        metrics, differential methylation for CpG Sites, differential
        methylation for CpG Islands, integration with gene expression
        data, and visualization of methylation values.

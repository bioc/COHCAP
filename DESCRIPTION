Description: COHCAP (pronounced "co-cap") provides a pipeline to analyze
        single-nucleotide resolution methylation data (Illumina 450k/EPIC
        methylation array, targeted BS-Seq, etc.). It provides differential
		methylation for CpG Sites, differential methylation for CpG Islands,
		integration with gene expression data, with visualizaton options.
